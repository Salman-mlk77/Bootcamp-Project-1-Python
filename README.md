# Cinema Booking System
This program is a **simple cinema booking system** that allows users to view available movies and book tickets for a selected movie.

## Movie List and Ticket Prices
The movie list and ticket prices are defined using a dictionary. Each movie is associated with its ticket price:

```python
movies = {
    "Joker": 50,
    "The Godfather": 40,
    "Parasite": 45,
    "John Wick": 35,
    "Forrest Gump": 30
}
``` 
## Tax Calculation
A lambda function is used to calculate the tax on the total ticket cost. The tax is set at 15% of the ticket cost:

```python
tax = lambda amount: amount * 0.15
``` 

## Displaying Available Movies
The display_movies() function is responsible for showing the list of available movies to the user:
```python
def display_movies():
    print("Our available movies:")
    for movie, price in movies.items():
        print("â€¢ " + movie + " - SAR" + str(price))
``` 
## Booking Tickets
The book_tickets() function is used to book tickets for a selected movie. It takes the movie name and the number of tickets as input. It then calculates the total cost, adds the tax amount, and displays the booking details:
```python
def book_tickets(movie, num_tickets):
    if movie in movies:
        price = movies[movie]
        total_cost = price * num_tickets
        total_cost_with_tax = total_cost + tax(total_cost)
        print("Booked", num_tickets, "ticket(s) for the movie", movie)
        print("Total cost: SAR" + str(total_cost))
        print("Total cost including tax: SAR" + str(total_cost_with_tax))
    else:
        print("Sorry, the movie is not available.")
``` 
## Main Program
The main program welcomes the user to the cinema booking system, displays the available movies using display_movies(), and prompts the user to enter the movie they want to book tickets for. It continues to take user input until the user chooses to exit:
```python
print("Welcome to the Cinema Booking System!")
display_movies()

while True:
    movie = input("Please enter the movie name you want to book tickets for (or 'exit' to quit): ")

    # Capitalize the movie name entered by the user for case insensitivity
    movie_capital = movie.title() 

    if movie_capital.lower() == "exit":
        print("Thank you! See you next time.")
        break

    if movie_capital in movies:
        num_tickets = int(input("Please enter the number of tickets you want to book: "))
        book_tickets(movie_capital, num_tickets)
    else:
        print("Sorry, the movie is not available.")
``` 

## Output:
A welcoming message to the user, displaying the available movies.
